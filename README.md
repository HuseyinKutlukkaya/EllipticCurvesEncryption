# Encryption With Elliptic Curves
Created On :‎7 ‎May 2018
It is an application that performs encryption using elliptic curves.
# What are Elliptic Curves?
Elliptic curves are sets of points that satisfy a cubic equation with a squared function.
For current cryptographic purposes, an elliptic curve is a plane curve on a finite body (rather than real numbers) consisting of points satisfying the following equation, represented as y^2=x^3+ax+b. A line drawn to the elliptic curve from the horizontal axis can intersect at 3 points.
